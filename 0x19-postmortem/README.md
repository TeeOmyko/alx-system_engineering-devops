**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**
**Duration:** August 10, 2023, 14:30 - August 11, 2023, 06:45 (UTC)
**Impact:** The web application experienced intermittent downtime and significant slowdowns, affecting approximately 30% of users. Users encountered delays in loading pages and experienced occasional errors during their interactions.

**Root Cause:** A database connection leak in the application's backend code led to gradual resource exhaustion over time. As a result, the database server became overwhelmed, causing query timeouts and degraded performance.

**Timeline:**
- **August 10, 2023, 14:30 (UTC):** Issue detected as monitoring alerts flagged increased response times.
- **August 10, 2023, 14:45 (UTC):** Engineering team began investigating, suspecting a front-end caching issue.
- **August 10, 2023, 15:30 (UTC):** Misleading investigation into front-end caching ruled out.
- **August 10, 2023, 16:00 (UTC):** Incident escalated to database team due to suspected database server overload.
- **August 10, 2023, 18:00 (UTC):** Database team started optimizing queries and indexes to alleviate performance issues.
- **August 10, 2023, 22:00 (UTC):** Despite database optimizations, issues persisted. Further investigation led to backend code review.
- **August 11, 2023, 03:30 (UTC):** Root cause identified - database connection leak in backend code.
- **August 11, 2023, 04:15 (UTC):** Development team deployed a code fix to close database connections properly.
- **August 11, 2023, 06:45 (UTC):** Application performance fully restored after code deployment.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The root cause of the issue was a connection leak in the backend code, which resulted in unclosed database connections over time. As the application processed user requests, it failed to release connections back to the connection pool. This caused the database server to run out of available connections, leading to query timeouts and degraded performance.

To resolve the issue, the development team implemented a code fix that ensured proper closure of database connections after each request. The fix involved enhancing the connection management logic to release connections back to the pool, preventing leaks and resource exhaustion.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
**To Improve/Fix:**
1. **Automated Testing:** Strengthen automated testing to include connection leak detection and performance degradation scenarios.
2. **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring of database connection usage and application performance to quickly identify anomalies.
3. **Regular Code Review:** Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address potential resource leakage issues.
4. **Thorough Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation on connection management best practices for developers.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**
1. **Code Audit:** Conduct a thorough audit of the application's backend code to identify and rectify any potential connection leaks.
2. **Database Scaling:** Evaluate and plan for database scaling strategies to accommodate future growth and avoid resource constraints.
3. **Emergency Response Plan:** Develop a clear incident response plan outlining steps for timely issue detection, escalation, and resolution.
4. **User Communication:** Establish a streamlined communication process to keep users informed during service disruptions.

In conclusion, the outage was caused by a database connection leak in the application's backend code, resulting in intermittent downtime and slowdowns. The issue was identified through a series of investigations and escalated to various teams. A code fix was deployed to address the root cause, and measures are now in place to prevent similar incidents in the future, including enhanced monitoring and code review practices.
